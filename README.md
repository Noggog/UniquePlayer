# UniquePlayer

Duplicates all races (supported by RaceCompatability.esm), creating a player-specific version that uses meshes under `Data\Meshes\Player\Meshes\...` and textures under `Data\Textures\Player\Textures\...`.

You can generate meshes using OutfitStudio by batch building into `Data\Meshes\Player`.
